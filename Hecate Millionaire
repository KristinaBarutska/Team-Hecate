Project purpose:
We built a game of type: questions and answers.In the first time user must choose his player name.
 After that he gets a lots of questions and he must give his answer (a, b, c or d).If he answered correctly he gets 100 score +.
 If he have passed more than 3 answers he gets Bonus Joker types: FiftyFifty, CallFriend, PublicJoker and can gets Bonus joker: Skepe question.
 If he answered wrong 3 more times the game has stopped for him => Game Over time.Else he did not won the game,
 but has a good experience like Hecate boy :)
 The purpose is player to answered correctly to all questions, no exceptions!And player to be happy,of course :)
